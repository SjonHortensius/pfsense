# Repo merged to main pfsense repo

This repository has been used to do most of the heavy lifting for migrating pfSense to Twitter Bootstrap. This work has now been completed; you can checkout everything we did [here](https://github.com/SjonHortensius/pfsense/tree/bootstrap).

This repository has been merged with the official repo; the migration [continues there as well](https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense)
